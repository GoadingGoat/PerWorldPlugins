PerWorldPlugins
===============
A note from goat:

Forked from https://github.com/MylesIsCool/PerWorldPlugins.

Have updated code to compile against 1.11 using maven. 
I have not improved this plugin in anyway... just made it work!
An improved version is under way at https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/perworldplugins-unofficial-update-version.6454/
but i couldn't wait...
